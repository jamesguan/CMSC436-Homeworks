# CMSC436-HW1
I am James Guan and I am submitting my assignment for HW1 on github.

  The visualizations contained include 2 verticle representations with d3.js.
These visualizations use a white canvas with red to black gradient
to provide a clean background so you can focus on the diffusion tensor image.
The other one is created with a black background and gray gradient. 
However, this has more of a bias towards the values closer to one
as the values closer to 0 are harder to see with the black.

The other 2 horizontal visualizations were created with OpenGL. 
The blue one was created with a hint of green to better add variety
and contrast to the data. The red and green uses red to highlight even
the values close to 0 and the green highlights the values closer 1. 
However, I just realized this visualization might be a bit more confusing.
